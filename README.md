# desire2learn
A mobile Desire2Learn app for the University of Colorado Boulder

## Note: 
- This app is in pre-alpha stages, and is coded pretty basic.
- CU Boulder is moving to a new LMS, so this will only be usable for the next year or two.
- Code is uncommented

## Todo:
- [x] Login to CU desire2learn system
- [x] Store login credentials securely using keychain
- [x] Retrieve courses and assignments
- [x] Load attachments using the session cookie
- [ ] Add detailed grade view for each assignment
- [ ] Add quiz section
- [ ] Build failsave to detect when app is still in ram but the session key is invalid
- [ ] Moodle courses (this is hard because moodle authenticates with the colorado login page)
